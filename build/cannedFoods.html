   <h2> Canned Foods </h2>
   
       <p>Canned food also knows as preserved food. Canned food product always describe in the term of ready meal. In the 19th century, canned food products were introduced in the market but with limited choice. This product was offered the convenience to the consumers at that time period.</p>
<p>In the time to time, those companies have introduced difference type of canned food to allow the consumer to choose. The category of canned food include beans, fish/seafood, fruit, meat and meat products, pasta, soup, tomatoes, vegetables and other. The taste of the canned food was having an improvement to more palatable.</p>
<p>Compared to other food product such as fresh food, frozen food, instant food product and so on, canned food products were especially popular with consumer who did not have a great deal of cooking experience or time to prepare meal. Therefore, the demand of canned food products was increase higher than past. Through the investigation, the result shows that canned food sales have reach to RM 961 million in 2011 (passport, 2011).</p>
<p>Consumers purchase canned food products are due to canned food product offer the convenience, at affordable price, longer shelf-life which within 2 years, and easier storage. Mostly, canned food products are targeted to the office ladies who are no time to purchased fresh food in the market. But some of the consumer will purchased the canned food product due to the nutritional value that has listed down on the label. Therefore, different consumers have difference perception toward the canned product to influence themselves to making the purchase decision.</p>
<p><br><br>
Consumer always have their own reason to purchase the product whether food, apparel, daily product and so on. Customer purchase decision is based on the eight mental which include perfectionist, brand consciousness, novelty and fashion conscious, recreational and shopping conscious, price conscious, impulsiveness, confused by overchoice and brand loyal (Sproles and Kendall, 1986). Other than that, functional need and emotional (Consoh, 2009) need also influence the customer purchase decision.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many companies offer their own brand canned product to attract the target consumer. For example, in the bean canned food which have Yeo&#39;s brand, Ayam brand and so on. Consumers have their own perception toward the particular canned product and make a purchase decision toward the particular brand products. In major of consumer perception, canned food products have a bad reputation for being less nutritious and contain preservative ingredients in the foods.</p>
<p>In the particular season or period, a certain fresh foods are unavailable in the market or groceries store. For example, some fruits are produce just in the particular season such as laici. Consumer may need to switch the choice to preserved food such as frozen, dry and canned food products.</p>
<p>Purchase decision of consumers is the major problem, consumers have their decision on whether to purchase the product or not. Moreover, almost every purchase has its own reason.
<br><br></p>

<p>Literature Review
Consumer Purchase Decision
According to Consoh (2009) the purchase decisions of customers are driven by two kinds of needs: functional needs satisfied by product functions and emotional needs associated with the psycological aspects of product ownership. The products must generate emotions but also present good functionality (traditional attributes).</p>
<p>Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard (1995) present the most recognized model of consumer purchase decision-making. This model divides the consumer purchase decision process into 5 stages: 1) problem recognition, 2) information search, 3) alternative evaluation, 4) purchase decision, and 5) post purchase behavior. With the aid of this model, Engel et al. (1995) have also identified some factors that affect consumer purchase decision making. These factors fall into three categories: 1) personal, 2) psychological and 3) social.</p>
<p>According to Kurniawan (2010) mentioned that in the past, investigation on consumer decision-making issues were mainly focused n the decision-making process. However, Bettman (1979) argues that consumers may sometimes typically rely on simple strategies, rather than going through a series of steps or processes rationally when they made purchase decisions, they may simply.</p>
<p>Sproles and Kendall (1986) define a Customer Decision Making style as &quot;a mental orientation characterizing a consumer&#39;s approach to making choices.&quot; In the Customer Style Inventory (CSI), Sproles and Kendall have indentified of eight mental consumer&#39;s decision-making styles or characteristic. There are</p>
<p>Decision style</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Perfectionist/high quality-conscious consumer: decision style of consumers who systematically search for the best quality products possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Brand consciousness/price equals quality: decision style of consumers concerned with getting the most expensive, well-known brands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Novelty and fashion conscious: decision style of consumers who like new and innovative products and who gain excitement from seeking out new things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recreational and shopping conscious: decision style of consumers who take pleasure in shopping and who shop just for the fun of it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Price conscious/value for the money: decision style of consumers who are concerned with getting lower prices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Impulsiveness/careless: decision style of consumers who tend to buy spontaneously and who are unconcerned about how much money they spend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Confused by overchoice: decision style of consumers who feel they have too many brands and stores to choose from and who likely experience information overload in the market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Habitual/brand loyal: decision style of consumers who shop at the same stores and tend to buy the same brands each time.
<br></br>
Canned Foods
According to Rogers (2011) Canned food which is first appeared in the 19th century that offer the convenience and variety of foods that can be easily prepared. The improvement in taste of today&#39;s canned foods may make them a more palatable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Roussell (2011) the convenience of canned food is undeniable. They have a long shelf life, are compact and east to carry and store, But they also have the reputation of being cheap, low-quality fare, loaded with sodium and preservatives.</p>
<p>Price
Schiffman and Kanuk (2004) have explained the perception about the price of a particular brand or product. This means that how they evaluate a particular brand&#39;s price as fair or low or high. It is also stated by them that perception about unfairness of price of a particular product lays an impact on the consumers&#39; decision to buy or not to buy a particular product. Moore et al (2003) has explained that negative perceptions and positive perceptions have an important impact on the decisions about the marketplace.</p>
<p>Different other studies have explained the perception of price as an element which can play an important role in the success of a firm (Jiang, 2004). Moore et al.</p>
<p>(2003) has described that positive perception of consumers about a particular brand is an indicator of status, quality and prestige; i.e. factors other than price. This aspect is also covered in our research through the study of extraneous variables.</p>
<p>First factor of consumer&#39;s decision-making styles is price consciousness/value of money. Creyer and Ross (1997) suggest that when the consumersâ€Ÿ price consciousness increases, &quot;demand for products that offer the highest benefit-to-cost ratio is likely to increase&quot;. This means that consumers are likely to consider the most valuable product at the most acceptable or lower price than the retail quality, fashion conscious, and brand loyalty. In addition, they also examined the factors between price and quality, and found that most of the consumers are tend to select the lower price products, but with a higher value option, rather than select the higher price products, with a guaranteed best quality option. This is also supported by Bucklin et al. (1998). He stated that price consciousness is significantly influences consumer&#39;s decision-making or choice and thus affects the purchase decision. He also found that, price conscious consumers are sensitive with the discount price and would switch to that brand and makes the consumersâ€Ÿ purchases early than usual require.</p>
<p>Consumers usually form price expectations to assist their purchase decision for a product. These price expectations are then used as reference points to compare with store prices and make purchase decisions (Monroe 1973).</p>
